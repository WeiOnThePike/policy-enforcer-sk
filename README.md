# Policy Enforcer

A ReAct agent using Semantic Kernel showcasing business rule enforcement in autonomous AI agents using Semantic Kernel with OpenAI integration and comprehensive testing infrastructure.

For Langchain version, refer to [this repo](https://github.com/smartnose/policy-enforcer)

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build an AI agent that enforces business rules without hardcoding workflows. The agent helps users choose activities (Play games, Go Camping, Swimming) while automatically enforcing predefined business policies through a robust testing framework.

**Note:** *Our way of enforcing policy check is independent from LLM-based guardrails. The business rules here are deterministic (unless your rule actually calls other non-deterministic code)*

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🤖 Dual Agent Architecture**: Both Semantic Kernel + OpenAI chat completion (gpt-4o-mini)
- **📋 Business Rule Enforcement**: Automatic validation of business rules before tool execution
- **📊 State Management**: Tracks user inventory, weather conditions, and activity choices
- **⚖️ Policy Engine**: Flexible rule system with explainable failures
- **🔬 Ablation Study Support**: Compare agent behavior with/without explicit rules in prompt
- **💻 Command Line Interface**: Interactive CLI for demonstration
- **🧪 Comprehensive Testing**: 50+ unit tests with 97% coverage on core modules
- **🔧 VS Code Integration**: Full debugging and testing support
- **📈 Coverage Reporting**: HTML, XML, and terminal coverage reports

## 📋 Business Rules

The demo implements the following business rules:

1. The user must have a TV and an Xbox before they can play games
2. The user must have Hiking Boots before they can go camping
3. The user must have Goggles before they can go swimming
4. If the weather is raining, the user cannot go camping
5. If the weather is snowing, the user cannot go swimming
6. If the weather is unknown, the user can only play games
7. If the weather is already known, the weather tool cannot be called again

## 🛠️ Available Tools

1. **Check Weather**: Returns a random weather condition (sunny, raining, snowing)
2. **Shopping**: Mock API to purchase items and add them to inventory
3. **Choose Activity**: Validates and sets the user's chosen activity
4. **Check State**: View current inventory, weather, and activity status

## 🏛️ Architecture

### Dual Implementation Approach

**1. Semantic Kernel + OpenAI** (`main.py`)
- Uses Microsoft Semantic Kernel framework
- OpenAI as the model provider
- Rich plugin system with automatic tool conversion
- Enterprise-ready with comprehensive abstractions

**2. Direct OpenAI** (`main_openai.py`) 
- Direct OpenAI API integration
- Native tool calling support
- Simpler implementation (200 vs 500 lines)
- Cost-optimized with GPT-4o-mini

### Core Components

**State Management**
- `AgentState`: Pydantic model tracking inventory, weather, activity
- Global state instance with singleton pattern
- Thread-safe state updates during tool execution

**Business Rules Engine**
- `RuleEngine`: Evaluates rules with clear explanations
- `RuleResult`: Structured rule validation responses
- Rules checked before tool execution and activity selection

**Policy-Enforced Tools**
- `PolicyEnforcedPlugin`: Base class with automatic rule checking
- Tools return clear violation messages for agent replanning
- Consistent state updates across all tools

**ReAct Implementation**
- Custom ReAct agent with real-time thinking display
- Simplified non-streaming approach for reliability
- Full conversation context maintenance

## 🔧 Configuration

### VS Code Launch Configurations
- **"Policy Enforcer - Semantic Kernel with OpenAI"** - Main agent
- **"Policy Enforcer - OpenAI (Direct)"** - Direct OpenAI agent
- **"Run Tests with Coverage"** - Test suite with coverage
- **"Run Unit Tests"** - Quick unit test run

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for full agent functionality
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Optional settings
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini        # Default model
TEMPERATURE=0.1                 # Default temperature
```

### Model Options
- `gpt-4o-mini` (default) - Cost-effective with tool calling
- `gpt-4o` - Enhanced capabilities  
- `gpt-4` - Maximum performance
- Any OpenAI model with tool calling support

## 🎯 Key Design Principles

1. **🔄 Separation of Concerns**: Business rules separate from agent logic
2. **💡 Explainability**: Rule violations provide clear explanations  
3. **🔧 Flexibility**: New rules added without changing agent code
4. **📊 State Tracking**: Consistent state management across components
5. **🛡️ Graceful Failure**: Rules guide agent to alternative actions
6. **🧪 Comprehensive Testing**: 97% coverage with multiple test types
7. **⚡ Dual Architecture**: Choice between Semantic Kernel and direct OpenAI

## 🔍 Advanced Features

### Ablation Study Support
```bash
# Agent with explicit rules in prompt
python main.py --rules

# Agent learns rules through tool feedback
python main.py --no-rules
```

### Real-time Agent Thinking
- See agent reasoning process as it happens
- Tool execution with before/after state display
- Clear action → observation → replanning flow

### Comprehensive Error Handling
- API key validation and helpful error messages
- Graceful degradation when API unavailable
- Clear user guidance for common issues

### Development Tools
- Make commands for common tasks
- VS Code integration with debugging
- Coverage reporting with multiple formats
- Legacy test preservation

## 📊 Performance & Metrics

### Model Performance
- **GPT-4o-mini**: ~$0.15 per 1M tokens (cost-effective)
- **Average Response Time**: 2-4 seconds for complex scenarios
- **Token Efficiency**: Optimized prompts reduce token usage

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: 97% coverage on state and items modules
- **Integration Tests**: Full scenario coverage
- **Error Scenarios**: Comprehensive edge case testing
- **Performance Tests**: Memory and speed validation

### Reliability
- **Rule Enforcement**: 100% business rule compliance
- **State Consistency**: No cross-test contamination
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of API failures

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- [ ] **Database Rule Storage**: Dynamic rule loading from database
- [ ] **Multi-Agent Support**: Coordinated agent interactions
- [ ] **Rule Versioning**: A/B testing of different rule sets
- [ ] **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed agent behavior metrics
- [ ] **Custom Model Support**: Azure OpenAI, Anthropic integration

### Enterprise Extensions
- [ ] **Audit Logging**: Complete action history with compliance tracking
- [ ] **Role-Based Rules**: Different rules for different user types
- [ ] **Real-time Rule Updates**: Hot-reload rules without restart
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: OpenTelemetry integration
